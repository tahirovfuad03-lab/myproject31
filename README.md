# Personal Website (template)

This workspace contains a simple static personal website with the following pages:

- `index.html` — Home page with profile photo and short bio.
- `about.html` — Background, qualifications, activities.
- `projects.html` — Projects list (includes Project 1 and optional Project 2).
- `resume.html` — Resume placeholder.

What to personalize
- Replace "Your Name" with your real name in all HTML files.
- Update the bio text, About page sections, and resume content.
- Replace `assets/profile.svg` with your real photo (drop a `jpg`/`png` into `assets/` and update `index.html`).
- Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo` in `index.html` footer with your public repo URL.
- Update the GitHub and Codecademy links in the nav to your profiles.

How to view
Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required for static files).

Making the repository public
1. Create a GitHub repository and push this folder.
2. Set the repo visibility to "Public" so the instructor can access it.
